# ScratchCat


  So far, in my project, when left arrow is pressed, cat sprite points towards left side of screen and moves 10 steps to the left. 
  When right arrow is pressed, sprite does the same but in the right respectively. 
  When up arrow is pressed, sprite moves up on y axis by 5 and then down y axis by 5. 
  When sprite is clicked, sprites shrinks to half size then after 0.05 seconds grows to normal size. 
  When space key is double pressed, sprite multiplies in a square number sequence while keeping to the same screen dimensions. 
  When down arrow is pressed, sprite shrinks to 45% then .5 seconds later grows to 200%.
